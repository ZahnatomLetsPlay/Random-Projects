# Random-Projects
Random projects that I've made (don't be confused about some of the names, I am from Germany)
All the projects here are open source. You're free to use my project's source code if you credit me.

1st The Pascal's triangle projects asks the user to input an amount of lines of the Pascal's triangle. Once "Generate" is pressed, the program will generate a file called "Pascal's triangle" in the same folder that the program has been launched from.
