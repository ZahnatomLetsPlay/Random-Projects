# Random-Projects
Random projects that I've made (don't be confused about some of the names, I am from Germany)
All the projects here are open source. You're free to use my project's source code if you credit me.

1st The Pascal's triangle projects asks the user to input an amount of lines of the Pascal's triangle. Once "Generate" is pressed, the program will generate a file called "Pascal's triangle" in the same folder that the program has been launched from.

2nd The SpaceDelyeeter project is a game where you fly a plane through space and doge asteroids. If you hit 5, the game is over. The game is also over if you manage to hit all the asteroids by either shooting them by pressing the spacebar or the left mousebutton. Keep in mind that this was a school project so I had to use their 3D library(which is in German). The .jar file should however run on any pc.
