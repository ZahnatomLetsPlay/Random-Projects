Random Projects that I've made (don't be confused about some of the names, I am from Germany)

The Pascal's triangle project asks you for an amount of lines off the pascal's triangle(works with 1000 lines) and a directory where to put the file(Pascal's triangle.txt). Once you've entered all the stuff it asks you for, it creates a file called "Pascal's triangle.txt" with the triangle correctly formated.
